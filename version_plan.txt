TITLE: X-Ray Engine version plan

Legend
------
- Planned
* In progress
+ Done
o On hold
? Decision pending
c Canceled

nitrocaster:
- Modules
  - subdivide xrGame into multiple modules
    (so changed code could be compiled faster)
  + merge xrCPU_Pipe into xrCore
  - merge xrAPI into xrCore
  - merge xrXMLParser into xrCore
- xrGameSpy
  + fix master server name (gamespy is down)
- xrCore
  - get rid of old blackbox code
  - refactor xrDebug
  - logger
    - don't keep log in std::vector, write to log file immediately
    - tweak CConsole to use new logger
- 3rd party libraries
  - detach/update ODE
    - dig through current ODE and analyze changes that were made by GSC
    - get the latest ODE and make sure it can be used with xray
  c detach NVTT
  - detach/update LuaJIT
  - detach/update LuaBind
  - update nvapi
  - update atimgpu (or (better) use amd ags instead)
- unknown crashes
  - AV at dBodyIsEnabled (dBodyID is invalid pointer)
    called from CSheduler::Update()+433
- known bugs
  - generic
    - stackoverflow when starting with too long command line
    - crash when game directory contains too many files
    - various crashes on some console commands
    - GetColorFromText bug
    - (bytes_need<=mSize) && vl_Count
  - core
    + xrMemory::mem_usage -> mem_usage_impl falls into infinite loop
      or finds bad nodes
    + correct CPU detection
  * multiplayer
    - dedicated server
      * known multiple vulnerabilities
	    + dirtysky
	    + stalkazz (fixed by GSC!)
      - log suspicious packets and kick/ban its senders after X attempts
      - remove unnecessary modules initialization (render/sound/etc...)
      - console (remove GUI and use separate administrative tool?)
	- ipv6 support
    - get rid of DirectPlay
  - render
    - if d3d compiler fails to compile some shader, it says
      "Your video card doesn't meet game requirements ..."
      even if GPU actually meets game requirements (vs/gs/ps levels)
      dx10ResourceManager_Resources.cpp
      CResourceManager::_CreatePS/_CreateGS/_CreateVS
- log messages
  - add console command for disabling detailed server log, i.e:
    downloaded 33792 from 34309 bytes of config from client [-1902085969]
    uploaded 33792 from 34309 bytes to client [-1965000538]
    file: 33792 of 34309 bytes received ...
    CL: On Update Request
	CL: On Update Respond from [player_name]
    BattlEye Server: Failed to resolve BE Master 'stalkercs1.battleye.com'
    BattlEye Server: Update attempt failed
  + fix log messages format (normally, the 'color' character should be 
    followed by a space)

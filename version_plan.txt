c Canceled

--------------------------------
nitrocaster:
- Modules
  - subdivide xrGame into multiple modules
    (so changed code could be compiled faster)
  + merge xrCPU_Pipe into xrCore
  + merge xrAPI into xrCore
  + merge xrXMLParser into xrCore
- 3rd party libraries
  - detach/update ODE
    - dig through current ODE and analyze changes that were made by GSC
    - get the latest ODE and make sure it can be used with xray
  c detach NVTT
  - update nvapi
  - update atimgpu (or (better) use amd ags instead)
- unknown crashes
  - AV at dBodyIsEnabled (dBodyID is invalid pointer)
    called from CSheduler::Update()+433
- known bugs
  - generic
    + stackoverflow when starting with too long command line
    + stackoverflow when game directory contains too many files
      - can me improved (get rid of recursive directory traversal)
      - exclude $app_data_root$/logs and $app_data_root$/screenshots
        from index
    - various crashes on some console commands
    - GetColorFromText bug
    - (bytes_need<=mSize) && vl_Count
  - core
    + xrMemory::mem_usage -> mem_usage_impl falls into infinite loop
      or finds bad nodes
    + correct CPU detection
    + buffer overflow when copying command line to Core.Params
    + misplaced arguments in calls to xrDebug::backend
  * multiplayer
    + xrGameSpy: fix master server name (gamespy is down)
    - dedicated server
      * known multiple vulnerabilities
	    + dirtysky
	    + stalkazz (fixed by GSC!)
        + stalkerbof (fixed by GSC!)
        + stalkerboom    
  - render
    - if d3d compiler fails to compile some shader, it says
      "Your video card doesn't meet game requirements ..."
      even if GPU actually meets game requirements (vs/gs/ps levels)
      dx10ResourceManager_Resources.cpp
      CResourceManager::_CreatePS/_CreateGS/_CreateVS
- improvements
  - multiplayer
  	- ipv6 support
    - get rid of DirectPlay
    - log suspicious packets and kick/ban its senders after X attempts
    - dedicated server
      - remove unnecessary modules initialization (render/sound/etc...)
      - use standard windows unput instead of DirectInput (causes problems
        on dedicated servers)
      - console (remove GUI and use separate administrative tool?)
      + remove topmost startup logo window
  - xrCore
    - get rid of old blackbox code
    - refactor xrDebug
    - logger
      - don't keep log in std::vector, write to log file immediately
      - tweak CConsole to use new logger
- log messages
  - add console command for disabling detailed server log, i.e:
    downloaded 33792 from 34309 bytes of config from client [-1902085969]
    uploaded 33792 from 34309 bytes to client [-1965000538]
    file: 33792 of 34309 bytes received ...
    CL: On Update Request
	CL: On Update Respond from [player_name]
    BattlEye Server: Failed to resolve BE Master 'stalkercs1.battleye.com'
    BattlEye Server: Update attempt failed
  + fix log messages format (normally, the 'color' character should be 
    followed by a space)

stalker2010:
- Modules
  - detach/update LuaJIT
  - detach/update LuaBind
